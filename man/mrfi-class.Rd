are included.}

are "m", "1", "2", etc. See \code{\link[=norm]{norm}} for details.}

\value{
A \code{\link[=mrfi-class]{mrfi}} object.

\code{as.list()}: converts the \code{mrfi} object to a list of interacting
positions (list of length-2 vectors).

\code{[[}: converts to list and subsets it.

\code{[}: subsets the \code{mrfi} object and returns another \code{mrfi} object.

\code{+}: computes the union of the interaction structure in a \code{mrfi} object with
a \code{numeric} representing an additional position to include or another \code{mrfi}
object.

\description{
The \code{mrfi} S4 class is a representation of the interaction
structure for a spatially-stationary Markov Random Field.

The function \code{\link[=mrfi]{mrfi()}} provides an interface for creation
\code{mrfi} objects. A \code{plot} method is also available for visualization, as
well as conversion methods like \code{as.list} and operators like \code{+}.

\code{mrfi()} creates an object of class \code{mrfi} based on a distance
rule and optionally a list of relative positions. The argument \code{max_norm} and
\code{norm_type} can be used to automatically include all positions within a
"range" defined by the norm type chosen and distance using that norm.

A list of relative positions may also be included to specify sparse
interaction structures, for example. Alternatively, \code{rpositions()}
can be used to create a based exclusively on a list of relative positions.

Simple operations are provided to include (set union)
new interacting positions to a \code{mrfi} object with the \code{'+'} operator and
remove positions (set difference) with \code{-}. Individual positions can be
included/excluded using length-2 vectors in the right hand side. Union and
set difference of complete structures can also be computed by adding or
subtracting two \code{mrfi} objects.

These operations deal with opposite directions filtering to avoid redundancy
in the interaction structure.
}
\details{
The interaction structure is defined by the list of relative
positions in it. For a specific pixel, conditional to the values of pixels in
these relative positions from it, its value is independent of any other pixel
in the image.

The relative positions are indentified by two integers \code{rx} and \code{ry}
representing the "shift" in the \code{x}-axis and \code{y}-axis respectively. As an
example: The relative position \verb{(1,0)} representes the pixel in the immediate
right position, while \verb{(-1,0)} the left one.

Note that the inclusion of a relative position to the dependence also implies
its opposite direction is not conditionally independent (commutativeness of
dependence), but only one is included in the \code{mrfi} object.

To illustrate that, a nearest neighbor dependence structure can be specified
by:

\code{mrfi(1)}

Note that it only includes the positions \verb{(1,0)} and \verb{(0,1)}, but when
visualizing it, for example, \code{mrf2d} understands the opposite directions
are also conditionally dependent, as in

\code{plot(mrfi(1))}.

\note{
If a position in \code{positions} is already included due to the
\code{max_norm} and \code{norm_type} specification, the second ocurrence is ignored.
The same is valid for repeated or opposite positions in \code{positions}.

\examples{
plot(mrfi(max_norm = 2, norm_type = "1"))
plot(mrfi(max_norm = 2, norm_type = "m"))
plot(mrfi(max_norm = 2, norm_type = "1", positions = list(c(4,4))))

as.list(mrfi(1))
mrfi(1)[[1]]
mrfi(2)[[1:3]]

mrfi(1)

mrfi(2)
mrfi(2, norm_type = "m")
mrfi(1, positions = list(c(4,4), c(-4,4)))


#Repeated positions are handled automatically
mrfi(1, positions = list(c(1,0), c(2,0)))

mrfi(1) + c(2,0)
mrfi(1) - c(1,0)
mrfi(1) + mrfi(0, positions = list(c(2,0)))
mrfi(2) - mrfi(1)
