Markov Random Fields are probabilistic models capable of describing sets
of random variables with a local dependence property (the Markov
property) defined on a neighborhood system. Particularly on the context
of image processing, pixels can be seen as vertices of a graph defined
on a finite 2-dimensional lattice, and a neighborhood system can be
defined based on their relative positions to construct a MRF.

The goal of `mrf2d` is to provide simple functions for sampling and
analysis of Markov Random Fields on 2-dimensional lattices, including
Hidden Markov Random Fields.

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of mrf2d from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("mrf2d")
```
-->

Currently, the package is only available as a development version on
Github. It can be installed with the `devtools` package by using

``` r
devtools::install_github("Freguglia/mrf2d")
```

The package will be available on CRAN as soon as a reasonable number of
features are added and well documented.

## Examples

<!--
Write something about Markov Random Fields 
-->

## Next Steps

I currently have most of the functions implemented already but proper
documentation is lacking, features will be added as soon as the
documentation is written. For any requests, e.g., implementation of a
particular model or method, feel free to file an issue and I can check
if it can be implemented within the current framework.

## Contributing and Bug Reports

If youâ€™re interested in contributing or found a bug or error, please
file an issue. Contributions can be done in form of code optimization,
new ideas, discussing new structures, etc.
