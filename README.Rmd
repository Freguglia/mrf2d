Markov Random Fields are probabilistic models capable of describing sets of random variables with a local dependence property (the Markov property) defined on a neighborhood system. Particularly on the context of image processing, pixels can be seen as vertices of a graph defined on a finite 2-dimensional lattice, and a neighborhood system can be defined based on their relative positions to construct a MRF.

The goal of `mrf2d` is to provide simple functions for sampling and analysis of Markov Random Fields on 2-dimensional lattices, including Hidden Markov Random Fields. It introduces the S4 class `mrfi` to describe interaction structures in a very general way, being able to adapt from very simple cases like the Ising Model to complex anisotropic models with different types of interaction.

plot(mrfi(), no_axis = TRUE)

plot(mrfi(max_norm = 2, positions = list(c(3,3),c(4,4), c(-2,4))), no_axis = TRUE)

## Installation
<!--
You can install the released version of mrf2d from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("mrf2d")
```
-->
Currently, the package is only available as a development version on Github. It can be installed with the `devtools` package by using

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Freguglia/mrf2d")
```

The package will be available on CRAN as soon as a reasonable number of features are added and well documented.

## Example

This is an example of what type of analysis you can do with `mrf2d`. More features are also present, including estimation of parameter in Markov Random Fields, families of parameter restrictions and more. Read the package's [vignette](https://freguglia.github.io/mrf2d/articles/guide.html) for more information and detailed description of the functions used: `browseVignettes("mrf2d")`.

We can define an interaction structure with the `mrfi()` function:

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=2, fig.height=2}
# We'll include dependence in nearest-neighbors only
int <- mrfi(max_norm = 1)
int
plot(int)
```

We can define a parameter array to sample from a MRF model:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# We have 2 interacting positions and we'll use a 3 color model, therefore,
# an array with dimensions (3,3,3) is used.
theta <- mrf2d:::vec_to_array(-1, family = "onepar", C = 2, n_R = 2)
theta
```

In short, the negative values out of diagonal means different "colors" are less likely in that relative position. We can sample from this model with:

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=5.5, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
set.seed(1)
img_dim <- c(200,200)
Z <- rmrf2d(img_dim, mrfi = int, theta = theta, cycles = 60)
dplot(Z, legend = TRUE)
```

We now add a Gaussian error and a linear effect to the image (to create a hidden Markov Random Field):

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=5.5, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
set.seed(1)
Y <- Z + 4 + 0.02*row(Z) + rnorm(length(Z), sd = 0.4)
cplot(Y)
```

We fit a Gaussian hidden Markov random field to recover the components:

```{r, echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
set.seed(3)
fit <- fit_ghm(Y, mrfi = int, theta = theta, 
               fixed_fn = polynomial_2d(c(1,1), dim(Y)), verbose = FALSE)
```

Check the results:

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width=3, fig.height=2.5, fig.show = 'hold'}
fit$par

library(ggplot2)
cplot(fit$fixed) + ggtitle("Linear Effect")
dplot(fit$Z_pred, legend = TRUE) + ggtitle("Predicted Z")
cplot(fit$predicted) + ggtitle("Predicted Value")
```

## Next Steps

Most of basic functionalities are already implemented, but the documentation is still being written.
