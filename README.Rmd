Markov Random Fields are probabilistic models capable of describing sets of random variables with a local dependence property (the Markov property) defined on a neighborhood system. Particularly on the context of image processing, pixels can be seen as vertices of a graph defined on a finite 2-dimensional lattice, and a neighborhood system can be defined based on their relative positions to construct a MRF.

<p>

The goal of `mrf2d` is to provide simple functions for sampling and analysis of Markov Random Fields on 2-dimensional lattices, including Hidden Markov Random Fields. It introduces the S4 class `mrfi` to describe interaction structures in a very general way, being able to adapt from very simple cases like the Ising Model to complex anisotropic models with different types of interaction.

```{r example_interacions, fig.show="hold", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
library(mrf2d)

plot(mrfi(), no_axis = TRUE)
plot(mrfi(max_norm = 2, norm_type = "m"), no_axis = TRUE)
plot(mrfi(max_norm = 2, positions = list(c(3,3),c(4,4), c(-2,4))), no_axis = TRUE)
```

## Installation
<!--
You can install the released version of mrf2d from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("mrf2d")
```
-->
Currently, the package is only available as a development version on Github. It can be installed with the `devtools` package by using

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Freguglia/mrf2d")
```

The package will be available on CRAN as soon as a reasonable number of features are added and well documented.

## Examples

<!--
Write something about Markov Random Fields 
-->

## Next Steps

I currently have most of the functions implemented on another private repository already but proper documentation is lacking, features will be added as soon as the documentation is written. For any requests, e.g., implementation of a particular model or method, feel free to file an issue and I can check if it can be implemented within the current framework.

Things to work in immediately:

 * Write the stochastic approximation algorithm with options to include simpler models as well as the most general with all different interaction types.

## Contributing and Bug Reports

If you're interested in contributing or found a bug or error, please file an issue. Contributions can be done in form of code optimization, new ideas, discussing new structures, etc.
